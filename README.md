# carnage-reporter

This program converts postgame carnage report screenshots into .csv files. To use this program, you need:
* the screenshot (must be in 480p)
* the font tag used in the screenshot (if the default font tag is being used, you can get this from the Halo Editing Kit
in tags/ui/large_ui.font)
* text files containing the names of players present (optional)

The syntax is: `<program> <path-to-screenshot> <path-to-font-tag> <path-to-output-csv> [names.txt-1] [names.text-2 ...]`
